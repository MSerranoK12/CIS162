<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Maria Serrano and I am currently on summer vacation. During the summer, I plan to take three summer courses at Cerritos Community College: two computer courses and a self-defense class. The computer courses are for career advancement and the self-defense class is part of my re-entry to martial arts.  About 10 years ago, I earned a blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and trained in Muay Thai but stopped because of injuries. I recently discovered Filipino Martial Arts, specifically Eskrima/Arnis, which is the perfect martial art for me because it is much easier on the joints.</p>

<h2>When I have free time</h2>
<ol>
<li>I read a book off my TBR list.</li>
<li>Practice eskrima/arnis - stick fighting.</li>
<li>Go to Dodger Stadium to catch a ball game.</li>
</ol>
<p>The web site I love visiting is the <a href="https://www.lapl.org/">Los Angeles Public Library</a> because there are so many free resources and I am able to check out digital versions of books and magazines.</p>
